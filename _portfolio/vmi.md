title: "Using Neighborhood-based Clustering to Categorize Visual Mental Imagery and Perceptual Domains"
excerpt: " Do both visual mental imagery (VMI) and perception exhibit domain- specific clustering? If yes, how similarly or differently? Using an English adaptation of the French Enhanced Imagery and Perception battery (eBIP), we aim to uncover the domain-specific nature of VMI and perception. By comparing performance scores, we seek to provide insights into their potential shared and distinct cognitive processes through dimension reduction and cluster analysis."
