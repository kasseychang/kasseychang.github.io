title: "A Comparative Study of Sentence-Final Particles Acquisition in Monolingual, Bilingual, and Trilingual Cantonese-Speaking Children: A Corpus-Driven Approach"
excerpt: " Sentence-final particles (SFPs) play a crucial role in expressing speakers' attitudes and intentions in Cantonese, making them integral to the language's pragmatics. Despite their importance, the acquisition of SFPs by Cantonese-speaking children has not been extensively studied, particularly in multilingual contexts. This study compares SFP frequencies and usage patterns across monolingual, bilingual (Cantonese-English), and trilingual (Cantonese-English-Mandarin) children to identify early versus late-acquired SFPs and determine influential factors such as language exposure, dominance, and cross-linguistic effects. The findings reveal that assertive particles are among the first acquired SFPs across all language backgrounds. However, bilingual children do not acquire SFPs as well as their trilingual counterparts, showing a slower acquisition rate and the non-acquisition of certain particles. This difference can be attributed to the lack of direct SFP cognates between Cantonese and English and the limited cross-linguistic facilitation from English. In contrast, the presence of SFPs in Mandarin, despite the lack of direct cognates, appears to provide some facilitative effects for trilingual children acquiring Cantonese. These results demonstrate the importance of considering cross-language influence and typological distance when examining SFP acquisition in multilingual contexts. The absence of direct SFP cognates between Cantonese and English, as well as the structural differences between the two languages, may hinder the acquisition of certain particles in bilingual children. The outcomes of this research enhance our understanding of SFP acquisition in Cantonese and contribute to the broader knowledge of language development in multilingual settings. By providing quantitative insights into the developmental progression of SFP acquisition across different language backgrounds and examining the role of language distance in shaping acquisition patterns, this study sets a foundation for future research on the acquisition of pragmatic markers in multilingual contexts and informs pedagogical strategies to support Cantonese language learners."
