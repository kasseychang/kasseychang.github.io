title: "Vowel Adaptation in English Loanwords Borrowed into Cantonese: A Data-driven Approach"
excerpt: "Throughout history, English loanwords have constituted a substantial component of the Cantonese lexicon, with the earliest recorded instances dating to 1828. A majority of these loanwords exhibit phonetically adapted syllables; for instance, /bʌs/ “bus” transforms into /pa1 si2/ in Cantonese. Certain loanwords meld a single phonetically adapted syllable with native Cantonese morphemes, such as /bɪr/ “beer” evolving into /pɛ1 tsɐu2/ (with tsɐu2 signifying “wine”). Predominantly, loanwords function as nouns spanning a range of semantic categories, including food and beverages, leisure, and the workplace (Wong, 2012). However, the central question remains: is the pattern of vowel adaptation in English loanwords entering Cantonese predictable?"
