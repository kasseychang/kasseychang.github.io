Hello! I am Katherine Chang (*zoeng1 cing4 man4*), usually go by **Kassey**. I'm an undergraduate student studying Linguistics and Computer Science at Columbia University.


My academic pursuits are fundamentally rooted in the importance and precision of data and statistical analysis. I firmly believe in drawing empirical insights from comprehensive, unbiased datasets to build a robust base for scholarly exploration. My research predominantly follows a data-centric approach, concentrating on **Corpus Linguistics** — from corpus design and compilation to corpus-based studies.

In the crossroads of Linguistics and Computer Science, I'm drawn to **Natural Language Processing/Understanding (NLP/NLU)**. This intersecting field allows me to probe into the complexities of conversation and discourse analysis. An intriguing aspect of my studies lies in deciphering the sophisticated mechanisms by which both computers and the human brain interpret language data — a realm that extends to **Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Linguistics/Science**. My aspiration is to bridge the gap between computational techniques and theoretical linguistic understanding, with a view to expanding the discussion on how technological advancements can replicate human cognitive functionalities.

Currently, I am working on two projects:
* **Visual mental imagery: an English-language assessment battery for different perceptual and imagery domains** (Funded by URF Summer Research Fellowship at Columbia)
* **SFP-based Semantic Annotator: From a Cantonese Perspective** (Tentative Senior Thesis)


As a dedicated language enthusiast, I speak Cantonese (Yue), English, German, Mandarin Chinese, and French. I am also in the process of learning Bahasa Indonesian (my heritage language) and Japanese.

When stepping away from my academic pursuits, I enjoy gardening, watching Broadway musicals, and films. 

Thank you for visiting my webpage. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to collaborate/have any awesome idea to share!
