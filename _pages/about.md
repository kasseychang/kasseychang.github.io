Hello! I am Katherine, usually go by Kassey. I'm a student studying Linguistics and Computer Science at Columbia University.

My academic journey is underpinned by the deep-seated belief in the significance and accuracy of data and statistical analysis. I maintain that extracting empirical insights from wide-ranging, objective datasets forms an integral part of creating a resilient foundation for academic investigations. My research approach primarily revolves around a data-driven methodology, with a focus on corpus linguistics, which includes corpus design, compilation, and corpus-based studies.

In the crossroads of Linguistics and Computer Science, my interest has been piqued by Natural Language Processing/Understanding (NLP/NLU). This interdisciplinary field grants me the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of conversation and discourse analysis. A captivating facet of my academic exploration is understanding the complex mechanisms through which both computers and the human mind decode and comprehend linguistic data, an area that spans both Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Linguistics/Science. My aspiration is to bridge the gap between computational methodologies and linguistic comprehension, with a view to expanding the discussion on how technological advancements can replicate, or perhaps even augment, human cognitive functionalities.

Currently, I am engaged in two exciting projects:
* "SFP-based Semantic Annotator: From a Cantonese Perspective" (Tentative Senior Thesis)
* “Patuá Macaense – The Macanese Creole Portuguese Written Corpus”
  * Corpus data collection in progress
  * Aims to compile a digital morphologically annotated corpus demonstrating the influence of superstrate and adstrate languages

As a dedicated language enthusiast, I speak Cantonese (Yue), English, German, Mandarin Chinese, and French. I am also in the process of learning Bahasa Indonesian (my heritage language) and Japanese.

When stepping away from my academic pursuits, I enjoy gardening, watching Broadway musicals, and films. 

Thank you for visiting my webpage. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to collaborate/have any awesome idea to share!
