Hello! I am Katherine "Kassey" Chang. I'm an undergraduate student studying Linguistics and Computer Science at Columbia University.

My journey weaves together a deep passion for linguistics and a strong proficiency in computer science, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computational linguistics.

I'm adept at applying computational techniques to linguistic data, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical linguistics and practical language technology. My expertise includes Python and Java programming, machine learning, and data analysis, underpinned by a rich research background in linguistics.

I'm currently engaged in various projects leveraging my skills in NLP and data analysis. 

As a dedicated language enthusiast, I speak Cantonese (Yue), English, German, Mandarin Chinese, and French. I am also in the process of learning Bahasa Indonesian (my heritage language) and Japanese. 

In my free time, I enjoy gardening, watching Broadway musicals and films.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration or to discuss innovative ideas!
