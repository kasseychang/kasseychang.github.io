I'm Kassey Chang, a language engineer building at the intersection of software systems, computational linguistics, and data infrastructure. I apply engineering principles and linguistic expertise to design, develop, and optimize multilingual systems that are robust, scalable, and production-ready.

### Professional Focus

My work spans several domains in language engineering and NLP systems:

- NLP pipeline architecture and validation
- Software engineering for multilingual infrastructure
- Data pipeline design for language processing and analysis

With experience in system validation, data pipeline engineering, and end-to-end development, I'm driven to solve complex problems in language technology at scale.
