# About Me

Hello! I am Kassey Chang, an aspiring computational linguist specializing in natural language processing. I combine my expertise in linguistics and computer science to evaluate and improve language technologies.

My work focuses on developing testing frameworks for NLP systems and ensuring linguistic accuracy across multiple languages. I work on complex challenges in syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, and cross-linguistic quality assurance. I'm particularly interested in how we can make language technologies more robust and linguistically accurate.

With a background spanning computational linguistics, UX research, and data analytics, I bring a multifaceted perspective to language technology development. I enjoy solving technical challenges while keeping linguistic precision at the forefront.


Feel free to reach out to discuss language technology or share interesting ideas about NLP!
