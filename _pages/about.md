Hello! I am Katherine "Kassey" Chang. I'm an undergraduate student studying Linguistics and Computer Science at Columbia University.

My research predominantly follows a data-centric approach, concentrating on **Corpus Linguistics** — from corpus design and compilation to corpus-based studies. At the crossroads of Linguistics and Computer Science, I'm drawn to **Natural Language Processing/Understanding (NLP/NLU)**, especially syntax and semantic parsing in low-resource languages. An intriguing aspect of my studies lies in deciphering the sophisticated mechanisms by which both computers and the human brain interpret language data — a realm that extends to **Computational Linguistics** and **Cognitive Science**. 

My aspiration is to bridge the gap between computational techniques and theoretical linguistic understanding, while making contributions to the field of **language technology**, with a view to expanding the discussion on how technological advancements can replicate human cognitive functionalities.

Currently, I am working on two projects:
* **Visual mental imagery: an English-language assessment battery for different perceptual and imagery domains** (Supported by URF Summer Research Fellowship at Columbia)
* **SFP-based Semantic Annotator: A Machine Learning Approach** (Tentative Senior Thesis)

As a dedicated language enthusiast, I speak Cantonese (Yue), English, German, Mandarin Chinese, and French. I am also in the process of learning Bahasa Indonesian (my heritage language) and Japanese.

In my leisure time, I enjoy gardening, watching Broadway musicals and films.

Thank you for visiting my webpage. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to collaborate/have any awesome ideas to share!
